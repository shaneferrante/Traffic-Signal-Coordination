# Traffic-Signal-Coordination
Junior Year Stem Fair Project Code

This was a Stem fair project with the goal of using machine learning to coordinate traffic lights in a simulated model to improve efficiency.

My Stem Thesis and Poster blueprint are under "STEM Thesis.pdf" and "Poster.pdf" respectively. All code is in the "Traffic" project folder.
